## About me

I have developed my character with the sum of the experiences shared with my family, colleagues and friends, in my professional path I have tried to learn from the achievements but more from the mistakes made. I dedicate a lot of time to the development and evolution of the people around me and I work on their well-being, which translates into my own.

I am a number one fan of technology, a devops enthusiast and an Open Source Lover, so I spend part of my free time researching and testing new proposals or solutions.
